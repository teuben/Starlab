Overview of Starlab</H1>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>What is Starlab?</B></LI>

<p>Starlab is a collection of modular software tools designed to
simulate the evolution of stars and stellar systems, and analyze the
resulting data.  Starlab consists of a library of loosely coupled
programs, sharing a common flexible data structure, which can be
combined in arbitrarily complex ways to study the dynamics and
evolution of binary and multiple star systems, star clusters and
galactic nuclei.

<P>The software is designed to be highly modular, allowing individual
tools to be combined in arbitrarily complex ways. Individual Starlab
modules may be linked in the ``traditional'' way, as function calls to
C++ (the language in which most of the package is written), C, or
FORTRAN routines, or at a much higher level--as individual programs
connected by UNIX pipes.  The former linkage is more efficient, and
allows finer control of the package's capabilities; however, the
latter provides a quick and compact way of running test simulations
and managing production runs.  The combination affords great
flexibility to Starlab, allowing it to be used by both the novice and
the expert programmer with equal ease. For example, in the command
sequence

<pre>
    makeplummer -n 1000 -i | makemass -l 0.5 -u 10 -F Scalo \
                           | add_star -R 1                  \
                           | scale -s                       \
                           | kira -S -t 100 -D 1            \
                           | lagrad -t                      \
                           | xhrdplot                       \
                           > save_snap.dat

<B>Target audience</B></LI>

<p>Starlab is intended for use by researchers in stellar dynamics who
wish to compute the evolution of dense stellar systems, but who may
not necessarily be experts in either N-body dynamics or in the details
of stellar or binary evolution. Starlab's modular software and data
structures are designed to allow experts in different field to combine
their knowledge without first having to become intimately
familiar with all aspects of the problem at hand.

<p>In the example given above, <TT>makeplummer</TT> sets positions and
velocities only, <TT>makemass</TT> modifies masses (knowing nothing of
the other dynamical variables), <TT>addstar</TT> adds stellar
properties to each particle (with no reference to or knowledge of
dynamics), <TT>scale</TT> scales the dynamics without reference to
physical stellar quantities, <TT>kira</TT> combines dynamical and
stellar information, <TT>lagrad</TT> knows nothing of stellar
evolution, and <TT>xhrplot</TT> knows nothing of dynamics. In
principle, the dynamics routines could have been written by a
programmer with no knowledge of stellar physics, while the
stellar-evolution programs require no detailed knowledge of dynamics.
The means by which this separation is accomplished is discussed in the
"<A HREF="../internals">internals</A> " section.</UL>

<LI>
<B>History</B></LI>

<p>To some extent, Starlab is modeled on <A
HREF="http://bima.astro.umd.edu:80/nemo/">NEMO</A>, a stellar dynamics
software environment developed during the 1980s at the Institute for
Advanced Study, in large part by Josh Barnes, with input from Peter
Teuben and Piet Hut (and subsequently maintained and extended by Peter
Teuben). Starlab differs from NEMO mainly in its use of UNIX pipes,
rather than temporary files, its use of tree structures rather than
arrays to represent N-body systems, and its guarantee of data
conservation--data which are not understood by a given module are
simply passed on to the next rather than filtered out and lost.

<P>The development history of Starlab is as follows
<BR><BR>
<UL>

<LI> 1.0, the original version, June 1993</LI>

<LI> 1.1, bug fixes and enhancements to 1.0, March 1994</LI>

<LI> 2.0, January 1995</LI>

<LI> 2.1, first version of kira, mid-1995</LI>

<LI> 3.0, initial implementation of stellar and binary evolution, mid-1997</LI>

<LI> 4.0, major internal reorganization and algorithm development</LI>

</UL>

<BR>Substantial internal rearrangements took place between versions
1.1 and 2.0, between versions 2.1 and 3.0, 3.2 and 3.3, and at
4.0. The latest version of the package may be obtained <a
href=../download>here</a>.

<LI> programs which create N-body snapshots</LI>

<LI> programs which apply some transformation to N-body snapshots</LI>

<LI> programs which perform time integration of N-body systems and
