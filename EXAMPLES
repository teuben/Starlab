How to perform specific common tasks using Starlab tools.
--------------------------------------------------------

Note:  Most tools are just simple interfaces onto the corresponding
       library functions, so the tasks listed below could in principle
       also be carried out by compiled  programs rather than by
       pipes.  However, the use of pipes is in many ways clearer and
       much more flexible.

       For more information on Starlab tools, see the file TOOLS in
       this directory.  For details on a specific tool, type

	   tool-name --help

  results graphically

  spectrum between 0.1 and 20 solar masses, add in a 10 percent 1-10 kT
  binary population, then rescale to unit total mass, total energy
  (top-level nodes) -0.25, and virial ratio (top-level nodes) 0.5, and
  finally verify the results by analyzing the final snapshot

  equal-mass circular binary and a double-mass incomer, with impact
  parameter equal to the binary semimajor axis, relative velocity at
  infinity half that needed for zero total energy, and all other
  parameters chosen randomly, and display the results as a movie
